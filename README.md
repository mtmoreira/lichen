Library Characterization Environment - Open source tool for Cell Library Characterization

LiChEn is implemented in C/C++ and is open source. It is based on the generation of a SPICE simulation environment where each standard cell has all its arcs and states exercised and its power and timing figures are characterized and exported to the Open Source Liberty format.

To install the tool, simply run:

make

This will create the binaries in the bin folder, that can be executed to start the shell mode.
